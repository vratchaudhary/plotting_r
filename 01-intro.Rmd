# Data preperation {#intro}



We can enter CSV data in R using read.csv function or read_csv function from readr package. However, for now we will use data that already exist in the datasets packages that we downloaded

Lets load the library 'datsets'
```{r include=TRUE}
library(datasets)


```


Lets look at the chickeweight data 

```{r include=TRUE}
head(ChickWeight)

```
